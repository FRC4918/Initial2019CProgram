# Initial2019CProgram
This is a first example of a robot program in C++.

It exercises everything on the simple pre-season drivetrain,
includes both autonomous and teleop modes, and includes some
experiments with CurvatureDrive() using mathematically-altered
(non-linear, to de-emphasize small inputs) joystick inputs.
